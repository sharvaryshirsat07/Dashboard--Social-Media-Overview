# Social Media Performance Dashboard - Power BI

## Objective

This project aims to provide a visual analysis of social media performance using Power BI. It focuses on key metrics such as follower growth, engagement, content performance, and the relationship between ad spend and follower count. The dashboard helps social media managers optimize their strategies by analyzing trends and performance across different content categories.

## Dataset Used

The following datasets were used to build the dashboard:

1. **Likes.xlsx**: Contains data on the number of likes each social media post received across different time periods. This helps analyze post engagement.
2. **Managers.xlsx**: Contains information on social media managers responsible for the posts, along with their respective ad spends and strategies.
3. **Social Media Analytics.xlsx**: A comprehensive dataset that includes metrics like follower count, engagement rate, post type (video, image, etc.), and content category. This forms the primary dataset for tracking overall social media performance.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The following KPIs are analyzed in the Power BI dashboard:

1. **Follower Growth**: Visualizes the increase or decrease in followers over time (monthly, quarterly).
2. **Engagement Metrics**: Tracks the number of likes, comments, shares, and overall engagement across content categories.
3. **Content Category Performance**: Analyzes how different types of content (videos, images, polls, etc.) perform in terms of engagement and follower growth.
4. **Ad Spend Impact**: Correlates ad spend with follower growth to understand the effectiveness of marketing efforts.
5. **Engagement Rate by Post Type**: Tracks how engagement rates differ between content types like videos, images, and educational posts.

## Process

1. **Data Collection**: Gathered social media data from **Likes.xlsx**, **Managers.xlsx**, & **Social Media Analytics.xlsx**.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Preprocessed the data to ensure consistency, handling missing values and ensuring correct data formatting.
3. **Power BI Dashboard Creation**: 
   - Imported data from the various files into Power BI.
   - Created visualizations such as line charts for follower growth, bar charts for engagement, and pie charts for content category distribution.
   - Set up filters and slicers to allow users to explore data by different time periods, content categories, and post types.
4. **Data Analysis**: Analyzed trends in engagement, follower growth, and ad spend to gain insights into social media performance.
5. **Insight Generation**: Used the dashboard to derive actionable insights for optimizing content strategy and ad spend.

## Dashboard Features

The dashboard includes the following visualizations and features:

- **Follower Growth by Month/Quarter**: Line chart showing how the follower count has changed over time.
- **Engagement Metrics by Content Category**: Bar charts showing total engagement (likes, comments, shares) for different content categories.
- **Ad Spend vs Follower Growth**: Scatter plot that visualizes the relationship between ad spend and follower growth.
- **Content Category Performance**: Pie chart representing the distribution of total engagement across different content types (e.g., video posts, educational posts, promotional posts).
- **Average Engagement Rate**: Line chart showing trends in engagement rates over time.

## Insights

- **Follower Growth Trends**: The analysis highlights key periods of rapid follower growth, often tied to high engagement content or successful ad campaigns.
- **Content Engagement**: Videos and polls generally result in higher engagement rates compared to image or text-based posts. This suggests that dynamic, interactive content resonates better with audiences.
- **Ad Spend Correlation**: There is a strong positive correlation between increased ad spend and follower growth, but it varies based on content type and audience targeting.
- **Content Strategy**: Identifying the most engaging content categories helps refine the social media strategy, ensuring that resources are allocated to high-performing content types.
